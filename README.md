The Better Breadboard Power SUpply is an alternative to the cheap Chinese knockoff breadboard power supplies. Features: USB-C power input SMD PTC resettable fuse support Large direct-solder power input pads THT pad for power LED or capacitor 20 2.54mm pins for rock-solid connection to the breadboard

I originally designed this for a 16-bit CPU project to tackle the problem of power distribution over a large amount of breadboards (15+). This little PCB turned out to work fantastically and I'm quite happy with the results so far. Next steps would to make the Vcc/Gnd connections configurable based on different breadboards and add a cooler logo. Also, I would like to use the high-power USB-C connectors, rather than the data version.
